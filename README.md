### Part2 (making classes)
- Make script a class structure

    - have an ```def __init__()``` method
    - have the class take in a file path and then save the contents to dictionary object with the key of the file name and the value be the contents of the file
    - create a new file and import your MyFileReader
        - use it to read in multiple files and then print them
        - (might be useful to do it in the python REPL)
            - to enter the python REPL type ```python``` in the terminal
